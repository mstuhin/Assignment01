            <p>it's been another demanding year for organisations in an environment beset by the by the pandemic,
                economic
                uncertainty and, more latterly, intensifying supply chain issues and disruptio. if anything supply
                chain issues and disruptio. if anything, 2021 has been just as tough as 2020 was!

                Thinking back to this time last year, most of us were looking forward to getting out of 2020 and hoping
                that
                2021 would be a more normal year, it wasn't. And it seems likely that 2022 will not be straightforward
                either;

            <h1>Mission</h1>
            <p>One of the tasks this year is to learn programming, and nothing else, just blind coding, That's why
                eating
                and
                drinking. Ajaira excludes all stories, watching games, watching movies, going for walks.

            <h1>Vission</h1>
            <p>'m looking forward to seeing the future of the developers, so I took this course.
                But in order to enjoy its fruits, one has to pursue abundance. Only then will Jhankar become a
                developer
                like
                his brother,
            </p>

        <div>
            <img src="illustrators/illustrator-3.png" alt="">
            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <p>The only thing I want to do is to make something that will benefit the people and make my country
                famous,
                So
                you
                have to learn the job well, because if you go to the field without learning the job, the notoriety
                will
                be
                more
                than the good name.
